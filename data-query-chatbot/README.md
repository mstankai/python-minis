# Data Query Chatbot
A Python-based chatbot that can query a data table and provide answers to user questions.
For this example I use the spotify song dataset from huggingface.

## Possible expansions
 - [ ] streamlit app api
 - [ ] extend to "huggingface dataset bot" – 
 user gives the name of the dataset and the bot pulls it and answers questions

## Set-up

1. Set up the parent repository – follow the readme in the base folder 
to set up the correct libraries, and the OpenAI API key.

From this repository.
1. Download the data by running the this python script:
    ```bash
    python scripts/0_download_data.py
    ```
